Pseudocode

- Check preconditions: 
	* is this the last recursive call?
	* are circles big enough to draw?
- If last recursion call, add pear circles with selected color, end function
- If not last recursion call
	* create current circle and add to list
	* shift x and y coord to the right 45 degree
		- recursively call to the right with new X, Y, angle, and depth minus 1
	* shift x and y coord to the left 45 degree
		- recursively call o the left with new X, Y, angle, and depth minus 1
